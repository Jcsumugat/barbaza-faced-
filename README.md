## Core Features

### 1. Household Profiling (FACED Form)

Digital version of the government Form 1-A. Captures:

- Location of affected family (region, province, municipality, barangay, evacuation center)
- Head of family personal information
- Family members table with vulnerability tagging
- Banking and account information for aid disbursement
- Housing and shelter damage classification
- Data privacy consent and scanned form upload

### 2. Vulnerability Assessment Index (VAI)

Automatically computed score used to prioritize households for aid. Maximum score is 110.

| Factor                 | Condition                                        | Points  |

| Family Vulnerabilities | Per member with any vulnerability (capped at 30) | +5 each |
| Shelter Damage         | Totally Damaged                                  | +30     |
| Shelter Damage         | Partially Damaged                                | +15     |

### 3. Record Status Workflow

```
[Barangay Staff] → SUBMITTED → [MSWDO Admin] → VALIDATED
                                             ↘ RETURNED → [Barangay Staff edits] → SUBMITTED
```

## Development Plan

### Phase 1 — Project Setup ✅

- ✅ Create Laravel project via Composer
- ✅ Install Laravel Breeze with Inertia + React
- ✅ Configure MySQL in `.env`
- ✅ Run base migrations (`php artisan migrate`)
- ✅ Import custom schema via phpMyAdmin SQL tab

### Phase 2 — Scaffold Files ✅

- ✅ Generate all Models via `php artisan make:model`
- ✅ Generate all Controllers via `php artisan make:controller`
- ✅ Generate Middleware via `php artisan make:middleware`
- ✅ Generate Form Requests via `php artisan make:request`
- ✅ Create Services folder and `VaiScoreService.php`
- ✅ Create all Inertia Pages and Components (jsx files)

### Phase 3 — Models & Relationships ✅

- ✅ `User` model — role-based attributes, barangay scope
- ✅ `FacedRecord` model — hasMany FamilyMembers, hasMany AssistanceRecords
- ✅ `FamilyMember` model — hasMany Vulnerabilities, belongsTo FacedRecord
- ✅ `FamilyMemberVulnerability` model — belongsTo FamilyMember
- ✅ `AssistanceRecord` model — belongsTo FacedRecord, belongsTo FamilyMember
- ✅ `SitrepConfig` model — belongsTo User
- ✅ `VaiScoreService` — server-side VAI calculation logic

### Phase 4 — Auth & Role Middleware ✅

- ✅ Laravel Breeze handles login / logout / registration
- ✅ Custom middleware: `EnsureRole` to restrict routes by role
- ✅ `HandleInertiaRequests` shares `auth.user` and `role` to all pages
- ✅ Flash messages shared via Inertia props

### Phase 5 — Controllers & Routes ✅

- ✅ `DashboardController` — aggregate stats per role scope
- ✅ `FacedRecordController` — full CRUD + status transitions
- ✅ `FamilyMemberController` — nested store / update / destroy
- ✅ `AssistanceRecordController` — create, approve, lock
- ✅ `SitRepController` — report builder + Gemini AI proxy
- ✅ `UserManagementController` — admin-only account management
- ✅ `ReportController` — filtered operational reports
- ✅ `ProfileController` — Breeze profile management
- ✅ All routes defined in `routes/web.php` with role middleware

### Phase 6 — Inertia Pages (React) ✅

- ✅ `Layout.jsx` — collapsible sidebar, top bar, flash messages
- ✅ `Dashboard.jsx` — stat cards + Recharts bar and pie charts
- ✅ `RecordsList.jsx` — paginated table with search and status filter
- ✅ `FacedForm.jsx` — full multi-section form with dynamic family members
- ✅ `SitRep.jsx` — 3-step report builder with AI summary generation
- ✅ `UserManagement.jsx` — account CRUD (admin only)
- ✅ `Reports.jsx` — filterable barangay and household report with print

### Phase 7 — Landing Page & Auth Pages ✅

- ✅ `Welcome.jsx` — dark landing page with Barangay Staff and Admin portal cards
- ✅ `Auth/Login.jsx` — role-aware login page matching system style
- ✅ `GuestLayout.jsx` — shared layout for Breeze password reset/email verify pages
- ✅ Role hint passed via URL param (`?role=staff` or `?role=admin`)
- ✅ Portal cards link to login with role pre-selected
- ✅ Back to portal link on login page

### Phase 8 — Registration & Auth Fix ✅

- ✅ `Auth/Register.jsx` — custom dark-themed registration page matching system style
- ✅ `RegisteredUserController.php` — updated to save `role` and `assigned_barangay`
- ✅ Role selector (Barangay Staff / MSWDO Admin) on registration form
- ✅ Assigned barangay dropdown conditionally shown for Barangay Staff
- ✅ Register link added to Login page, Login link added to Register page
- ✅ Fixed: SQL-inserted users failed login — use register form instead for accurate bcrypt hash

### Phase 9 — Bug Fixes & Debugging 🔄 CURRENT

- ✅ Fixed: `Layout.jsx` was empty due to `type nul` creation — repasted full export default
- ✅ Fixed: Duplicate `/` route removed from `web.php`
- ✅ Fixed: `/` now shows Welcome to guests, redirects auth users to dashboard
- Verify VAI auto-calculates correctly on every record save
- Enforce status transition rules (Submitted → Validated / Returned)
- Barangay Staff scoped to their assigned barangay only

### Phase 10 — File Upload & Print

- Store signed form uploads via Laravel Storage (local or S3)
- Print-friendly CSS already designed in prototype — port directly
- Optional: PDF export via `barryvdh/laravel-dompdf`

### Phase 11 — SitRep AI Integration

- Proxy Gemini API calls through a Laravel controller to protect API keys
- `POST /api/sitrep/generate-summary` → calls Gemini, returns summary text
- Add `GEMINI_API_KEY` to `.env` and `config/services.php`

## UI Style Guide

All pages follow a consistent design language ported from the original prototype. Strictly follow these conventions when building new pages or components.
